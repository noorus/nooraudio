nooraudio
=========

A small audio output library using WASAPI.  
Currently only supports the WASAPI push method.

Compiling
---------

The library should compile out of the box.  
To compile the vorbisplayer example, have `libogg-1.3.0` and `libvorbis-1.3.3` in the  
repository root, or change the include directories in the project settings.
